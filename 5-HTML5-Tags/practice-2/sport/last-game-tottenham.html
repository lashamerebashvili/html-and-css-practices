    <p>Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/)[1][2] or Spurs, 
        is a professional football club in Tottenham, London, England, that competes in the Premier League. 
        Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has been the club's home ground since 2019, replacing [3] their former home 
        of White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.

    <p>
        Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross in the London Borough of Enfield. Tottenham have 
        played in a first (home) strip of white shirts and navy blue shorts since the 1898–99 season. The club's 
        emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, with a Latin motto Audere est Facere ("To Dare Is to Do").
