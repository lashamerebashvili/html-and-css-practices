    <p>Chelsea Football Club is a professional football club in Chelsea, London, England, that competes in the Premier League,
         the highest tier of English football. The club has won six top division titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, 
         four FA Community Shields, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Europa League, and 
         one UEFA Super Cup.

        Founded in 1905, the club's home ground since then has been Stamford Bridge. Chelsea won its only First Division 
        title in 1955, but saw limited success in various cup competitions until 2003, when the club was purchased by Russian 
        billionaire Roman Abramovich.[8] Chelsea then saw heavy investment, and have since won 18 honours under Abramovich, 
        second in that time only to Manchester United.
