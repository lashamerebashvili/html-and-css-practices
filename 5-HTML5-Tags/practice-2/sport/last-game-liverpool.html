        Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at 
        Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and 
        European football in the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 
        11 League titles and seven European trophies. Under the management of Rafael Ben√≠tez and 
        captained by Steven Gerrard, Liverpool became European champions for the fifth time in 2005.
