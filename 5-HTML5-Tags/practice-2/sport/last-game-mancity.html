    <p>Manchester City Football Club is a football club based in Manchester, 
        England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English 
        football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Ardwick 
        Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's 
        home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, to which 
        it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923.

        Manchester City entered the Football League in 1899, and won their 
        first major honour with the FA Cup in 1904. It had its first major 
        period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, FA Cup and 
        League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. 
        After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of 
        decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football. 
        Having regained their Premier League status in the early 2000s, Manchester 
        City was purchased in 2008 by Abu Dhabi United Group for Â£210 million and 
        received considerable financial investment.
