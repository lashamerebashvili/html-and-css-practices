    <p>Everton Football Club (/ˈɛvərtən/) is a football club in Liverpool, England,
         that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. 
        The club have competed in the top division for a record 116 seasons, missing the top division only four times (1930–31 and
         three consecutive seasons starting with 1951–52) since The Football League 
        was created in 1888. Everton have won 15 major trophies: the League Championship nine times 
        (fourth most as of 2017–18), the FA Cup five times (ninth most) and the UEFA Cup Winners Cup once.

        Formed in 1878, Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won 
        their first League Championship two seasons later. Following four League Championship 
        and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period, 
        until a revival in the 1960s, which saw the club win two League Championships and an FA Cup. 
        The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success, with two League 
        Championships, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent 
        major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.
