    <p>Watford Football Club is a professional football club based in Watford, 
        Hertfordshire, England, that plays in the Premier League, the highest 
        level in the English football league system. Founded in 1898 by the 
        amalgamation of West Herts and Watford St. Mary's. After finishing the 
        1914–15 season as Southern League champions under the management of Harry 
        Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920.

        England manager Graham Taylor's tenure at the club saw Watford scale 
        new heights. Between Taylor's appointment in 1977 and departure in 1987, 
        Watford rose from the Fourth Division to the First Division. The team 
        finished second in the First Division in the 1982–83 season, competed 
        in the UEFA Cup in 1983–84, and also reached the 1984 FA Cup Final.[7]
